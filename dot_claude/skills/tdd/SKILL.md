# TDD Command

This command invokes the **tdd-guide** agent to enforce test-driven development methodology.

## What This Command Does

1. **Scaffold Interfaces** - Define types/interfaces first
2. **Generate Tests First** - Write failing tests (RED)
3. **Implement Minimal Code** - Write just enough to pass (GREEN)
4. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green (REFACTOR)
5. **Verify Coverage** - Ensure 80%+ test coverage

## When to Use

Use `/tdd` when:
- Implementing new features
- Adding new functions/components
- Fixing bugs (write test that reproduces bug first)
- Refactoring existing code
- Building critical business logic

## TDD Cycle

```
RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR -> REPEAT

RED:      Write a failing test
GREEN:    Write minimal code to pass
REFACTOR: Improve code, keep tests passing
REPEAT:   Next feature/scenario
```

## TDD Best Practices

**DO:**
- Write the test FIRST, before any implementation
- Run tests and verify they FAIL before implementing
- Write minimal code to make tests pass
- Refactor only after tests are green
- Add edge cases and error scenarios
- Aim for 80%+ coverage (100% for critical code)

**DON'T:**
- Write implementation before tests
- Skip running tests after each change
- Write too much code at once
- Ignore failing tests
- Test implementation details (test behavior)
- Mock everything (prefer integration tests)

## Coverage Requirements

- **80% minimum** for all code
- **100% required** for:
  - Financial calculations
  - Authentication logic
  - Security-critical code
  - Core business logic

## Integration with Other Commands

- Use `/plan` first to understand what to build
- Use `/tdd` to implement with tests
- Use `/build-fix` if build errors occur
- Use `/code-review` to review implementation
- Use `/test-coverage` to verify coverage
